The goal of isonoi is to provide example data and functions to demonstrate the concept of 'iso voronoi' polygons.

It is designed to be a prototype implementation of ideas outlined and demonstrated with example data and reproducible code in https://github.com/isonoi/streetvoronoi

Give it a spin with the reproducible examples shown below.

```{r, eval=FALSE}
remotes::install_github("isonoi/isonoi")
```

```{r inputs}
library(isonoi)
library(sf)
x = net_oldenburg_raw
hex = iso_grid(x)
plot(hex)
plot(x, add = TRUE)
```
