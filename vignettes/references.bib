ABSTRACT = {This paper investigated economic truck parking behavior to implement comprehensive Freight Loading Zone (FLZ) policies. We assumed that the delivery trucks can only park on FLZ. The proposed contribution is to quantify the cruising for parking time of trucks. We used a microscopic traffic simulation based on a Manhattan network and the real network of Lyon (France). This paper explored the relationship between the searching time, the parking probabilities and the region&rsquo;s parking density. Based on research results, an application to last mile cost function is proposed.},
